# Contributing to Co-Authors Plus

## Pull Requests

Please make pull requests against the `develop` branch.

Ideally include tests.

## Terminology: co-author vs coauthor

If talking about co-authors in a documentation, DocBlock, comment, or user-facing string, please include the hyphen.

Variables, constants, class, trait, interface, function, method, hook, and other programmatic names can all use no-hyphen.
