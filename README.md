## Usage

Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus/wiki) for detailed documentation.

## Installation

1. IMPORTANT: If you are using the original Co-Authors plugin, disable it before installing Co-Authors Plus.
2. Extract the coauthors-plus.zip file and upload its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Alternately, you can install directly from the Plugin directory within your WordPress Install.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
4. Place [co-authors template tags](https://github.com/Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus/wiki/Template-tags) in your template.
5. Add co-authors to your posts and pages.

## Screenshots

1. Multiple authors can be added to a Post, Page, or Custom Post Type using an auto-complete interface.
2. The order of your co-authors can be changed with drag and drop.
3. Guest authors allow you to assign bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. You can also override existing WordPress account meta by mapping a guest author to a WordPress user.
