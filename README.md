## Usage

Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus/wiki) for detailed documentation.

## Installation

1. IMPORTANT: If you are using the original Co-Authors plugin, disable it before installing Co-Authors Plus.
2. Extract the coauthors-plus.zip file and upload its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Alternately, you can install directly from the Plugin directory within your WordPress Install.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
4. Place [co-authors template tags](https://github.com/Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus/wiki/Template-tags) in your template.
5. Add co-authors to your posts and pages.

## Screenshots

1. Multiple authors can be added to a Post, Page, or Custom Post Type using an auto-complete interface.
2. Guest authors allow you to assign bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. You can also override existing WordPress account meta by mapping a guest author to a WordPress user.
