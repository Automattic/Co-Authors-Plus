Assign multiple bylines to posts, pages, and custom post types via a search-as-you-type input box

== Description ==

Assign multiple bylines to posts, pages, and custom post types via a search-as-you-type input box. Co-authored posts appear on a co-author's archive page and in their feed. Co-authors may edit the posts they are associated with, and co-authors who are contributors may only edit posts if they have not been published (as is core behavior).

Add writers as bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. Simply [create a guest author profile](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/add-guest-bylines-to-your-content-with-co-authors-plus/) for the writer and assign the byline as you normally would.

On the frontend, use the [Co-Authors Plus template tags](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/incorporate-co-authors-plus-template-tags-into-your-theme/) to list co-authors anywhere you'd normally list the author.

This plugin is an almost complete rewrite of the Co-Authors plugin originally developed at [Shepherd Interactive](http://www.shepherd-interactive.com/) (2007). The original plugin was inspired by the 'Multiple Authors' plugin by Mark Jaquith (2005).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add Co-Authors Plus support to my theme? =

If you've just installed Co-Authors Plus, you might notice that the bylines are being added in the backend but aren't appearing on the frontend. You'll need to [add the template tags to your theme](http://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/incorporate-co-authors-plus-template-tags-into-your-theme/) before the bylines will appear.

= What happens to posts and pages when I delete a user assigned to a post or page as a coauthor? =

When a user is deleted from WordPress, they will be removed from all posts for which they are co-authors. If you chose to reassign their posts to another user, that user will be set as the coauthor instead.

= Can I use Co-Authors Plus with WordPress multisite? =

Yep! Co-Authors Plus can be activated on a site-by-site basis, or network-activated. If you create guest authors, however, those guest authors will exist on a site-by-site basis.

= Who needs permission to do what? =

To assign co-authors to posts, a WordPress user will need the 'edit_others_posts' capability. This is typically granted to the Editor role, but can be altered with the 'coauthors_plus_edit_authors' filter.

To create new guest author profiles, a WordPress will need the 'list_users' capability. This is typically granted to the Administrator role, but can be altered with the 'coauthors_guest_author_manage_cap' filter.

= Can I easily create a list of all co-authors? =

Yep! There's a template tag called `coauthors_wp_list_authors()` that accepts many of the same arguments as `wp_list_authors()`. Look in template-tags.php for more details.
